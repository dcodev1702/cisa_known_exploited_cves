# CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilties & Microsoft Sentinel #
A dockerized solution to ingest CISA's Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (JSON) via Logstash (v8.X) w/ the new Sentinel plugin and using Azure Data Collection Rule (DCR), Data Collection Endpoint (DCE) and a JSON Sample file. <br />
The sample file used is a small subset CISA's file located [here](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog). <br /> 

Limited testing has been done.<br />
<br />
The goal of this effort is to provide the user a way of obtaining additional insight and intelligence leveraged from CISA as it relates to known exploited CVE's. <br />

Assumptions:
------------
1. You have required access to an [Azure tenant](https://portal.azure.com)
2. You have administrative access to a supported Linux VM (on premises or in cloud)
3. You're connected to the Internet
4. Install [Docker & Docker Compose](https://github.com/dcodev1702/cisa_known_exploited_cves/blob/main/install_docker.sh), Git, Python3, [Logstash](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/installing-logstash.html) w/ new Sentinel plugin is installed: <br />
    + [/usr/share/logstash/bin/logstash-plugin install microsoft-sentinel-logstash-output-plugin] <br />
    
    + Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y && sudo apt install python3-dev <br />
    + RedHat/Rocky: sudo dnf update && sudo dnf upgrade -y && sudo dnf install python3-devel <br />
5. You have the required access to build and run Docker containers
6. You can clone or download and unzip this repository


Instructions:
--------------
```console
git clone https://github.com/dcodev1702/cisa_known_exploited_cves.git
```
```console
cd cisa_known_exploited_cves
```
## Log into Microsoft Azure <br />
[Commerical Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) <br />
[US Government Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.us) <br />
<br />
Create Data Collection Endpoint (DCE) in Azure Monitor <br />

Create Custom Table via Log Analytrics Workspace <br />
  + Select the DCE you just created <br />
  + Use sample json file 'cisa-cveids-json-oneliner-sample.json' for KQL transformation.
  + Write KQL to normalize and transform the data as you desire.
Create App Registration w/ Secret <br />
```console 
sudo vi ./logstash/pipeline/cisa-cveids-dcr-sentinel.conf
```
Configure Logstash Sentinel Plugin to use DCE/DCR API (logstash/pipeline/cisa-cveids-dcr-sentinel.conf) <br />
  + Client App ID
  + Client App Secret
  + Tenant ID
  + Data Collection Endpoint (ingest url)
  + DCR Immutahle ID
  + DCR Stream Name (Custom-YOUR_CUSTOM_TABLE_CL)
Configure IAM in DCR
  + Add Role: Monitoring Metrics Publisher -> Application Registration

<br />
Start Logstash Container via Docker Compose <br />

```console 
docker-compose up -d
```
<br />
<br />
!!! Right now pulling down the CISA CVE Catalog is manual but this will be fixed soon !!!

```console
docker exec -it logstash bash

./cisa_cve_cronjob.sh

/usr/bin/python3 cisa_cve_compact_json.py

exit
```

<br />
Stop Logstash Container via Docker Compose <br />

```console 
docker-compose down
```

## Post Condition:
Once the Logstash container build is complete and running it will do the following.
 + Bash script enables a pre-configured cron job.
 + Cron job pre-configured to run once a day (change frequency as you desire)
 + The crong job will call a Python [script](https://github.com/dcodev1702/cisa_known_exploited_cves/blob/main/logstash/log/cisa_cve_compact_json.py)
 + The Python script will get the CISA's known exploited CVEs JSON file from their website.
   + TODO: Add logic to Python script to compare dateReleased in order to determine if a new catalog update should be applied!
   + Existing dateReleased (/var/log/cisa_cveids/cveids-oneliner.log) : CISA Catalog URL dateReleased ? [update | don't update]
 + The Python script wlll compact the downloaded JSON into one line and output to /var/log/cisa_cveids/cveids-oneliner.log
 + The Logstash Sentinel Plugin is configured to send that vuln data via the DCE/DCR REST API
    + docker logs logstash -f <br />
 + In the Azure portal, go to your Log Analytics Workspace -> Logs -> select your Custom Log -> Validate the CVE data was ingested.
 + Combine this information to create custom alerts/analytics to ensure your environment is free of known/active exploited CVEs
